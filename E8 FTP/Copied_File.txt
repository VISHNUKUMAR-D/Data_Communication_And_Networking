        6.Close all created ServerSocket, Socket and BufferedOutputStream objects.


        ALGORITHM FOR FTP_CLIENT:

        1.Create object for Socket and pass hostname and port number as arguement.
        2.Get the FileName from the user using scan.
        3.Create FileInputStream and BufferedInputStream object.
        4.Using the created objects read the contents of the given File and store in a Array.
